# Lab 6 : CEG 3400 Intro to Cyber Security

## Name:

### Task 1: `/home` sweet `/home`

Answer the following:

* What are all CIDR's in use in your home network?
* List all IP addresses that respond to a basic nmap scan: 
* Can you identify all devices on your network?
* How many online accounts and social media platforms are you on
  that hold non-trivial data about you?
* How many of these are critical for your organizations business goals?
* Do you know the Authentication policies of these critical accounts?
  * List all primary and secondary authentication methods for your most 
    important account, including non password related reset options 
    that might be vulnerable to an attacker.

### Task 2: Platform Inventory

Answer the following:

* My three Platforms (CPE's) (please provide both a link and a common name/version):
  1. [first cpe common name](www.first-cpe-link.com)
  2. [second cpe](second.com) 
  3. [third cpe](thrid.com)
* Why might having the CPE lookup for your most critical software be important
  for an organization to mitigate risk?

* My three vulnerabilities (CVE's) (please provide both a link and a common name, and a summary of each):

##### [first cve common name](www.first-cve-link.com)

Description

##### [second cve common name](www.second-cve-link.com)

Description

##### [third cve common name](www.third-cve-link.com)

Description

#### [The top 25 CWE that you fell prey to](link-to-cwe.com)

Description and writeup

#### [Top MITRE recon ATT&CK technique](link-to-technique)

Description and writeup as to why

### Task 3: Guess who

* List the top three threat vectors based on how likely they are to exploit your CPE/CVE's above.
  1. most likely
  2. 
  3. least likely
* Why did you choose these three?

* List the top three threat vectors based on how likely they are to exploit your CWE above.
  1. most likely
  2. 
  3. least likely
* Why did you choose these three?

* List the top three threat vectors based on how likely they are to exploit your MITRE ATT&CK Recon technique above.
  1. most likely
  2. 
  3. least likely
* Why did you choose these three?

### Task 4, 5, & 6 chart:

Please get full name of threat event from instructions.  Use the 0-10 scale 
for all likelihood, impact, and risk fields.

### Task 4: Eventually

1. List one other threat event that is likely and of concern to your organization.
2. Why did you choose this threat event?
3. Were there any other threat events that your organization should be concerned about?  
4. What are the pros and cons of using a list of threat events such as the one included
   in the NIST 800-20 tables E-2 and E-3?

---

### Task 5: Impact

There are no further questions for task 4.

---

### Task 6: Risky business

1. Add up all numbers in your risk column and list it here:
2. What threat events were hardest to determine the likelihood, and impact for? Why?
3. What areas would you target for risk mitigation?
4. What was the hardest part of this assessment (for you) and why?
