### Task 4: Eventually

1. List one other threat event that is likely and of concern to your organization.
2. Why did you choose this threat event?
3. Were there any other threat events that your organization should be concerned about?  
4. What are the pros and cons of using a list of threat events such as the one included
   in the NIST 800-20 tables E-2 and E-3?

---

### Task 5: Risky business

1. Add up all numbers in your risk column and list it here:
2. What threat events were hardest to determine the likelihood, and impact for? Why?
3. What areas would you target for risk mitigation?
4. What was the hardest part of this assessment (for you) and why?
